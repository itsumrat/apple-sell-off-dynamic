			      		<p>We always communicate with our customers in a polite, ethical and professional manner. We expect the same from our customers when they communicate with us over the phone, electronically (email) or in writing. While we understand that certain situations, such as a courier’s failure to deliver on time or a problem with our product may be stressful, it is also our duty to protect the safety and well-being of our staff. For this reason, our company has an Unacceptable Communication Policy which is set out below. Our staff will not tolerate communication from customers which we consider unacceptable, such as:<br>

						<ul>
							<li>Threatening, coercive or intimidating approach to resolve a problem;</li>
							<li>Aggressive, abusive or offensive language or behaviour;</li>
							<li>unreasonable persistency, urgency or unjustified demands.</li>
						</ul>

						If a customer communicates with us in an unacceptable manner, the first action of our staff will be to give a warning and ask the customer to change their approach or language accordingly. If the customer continues in this unacceptable manner, employees will terminate the conversation (if over the phone) or not reply to any further written or electronic (email) communication.<br>

						If the behaviour of the customer is extreme and it threatens the immediate safety and well-being of our staff, we will be forced to terminate communications without warning and if required, proceed by involving the police or taking legal action.</p>

						<h6>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h6>

						<h6>LAWFUL BASIS</h6>

						<p><b>Legitimate Interest</b> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience.

						<h6>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h6>

						<p>You have the right to:</p>

						<p><b>Request access</b> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>

						<p><b>Request correction</b> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>

						<p><b>Request erasure</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>

						<p><b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>

						<p><b>Request restriction</b> of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>

						<p><b>Request the transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>

						<p><b>Withdraw consent at any time</b> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>

					  	<p>At Appleselloff we always strive to deliver great products and an even greater costumer experience. However, sometimes technical malfunction might lead to an unexpected and unwanted outcome. Our warranty and return policy has been developed for just such occasions in order to guarantee the satisfaction of our customers.</p>

						<p>All products found in our web shop have been thoroughly inspected and approved by Apple-certified technicians. Therefore, we proudly provide 12 month warranty on everything we sell. The length of the warranty is determined by a number of factors, the most important one being the age of the product. Simply put, there is an inverse relationship between a product’s age and the length of the warranty, i.e. the older the product, the shorter warranty we are able to provide. Furthermore, for a small additional fee, we provide the possibility of extending the warranty by up to an additional 18 months.</p>

						<h6>RETURN POLICY</h6>

						<p>Our returns policy, which is in addition to the warranty, entitles you to return an item bought within 14 days for a full refund. The product must be returned in the same condition as you received it. The two-week long ‘purchase on approval’ period commences when either you, or a third party designated by you takes physical possession of the product.</p>

						<p>If you would like to return a product for a full refund, must send it back in the exact same condition as you received it via post within the two-week period.</p>

						<p>Please note that if any new external damage is found during the inspection, such as liquid damage or a cracked screen, we will be unable to issue a refund.</p>

						<h6>WHAT IS COVERED BY OUR WARRANTY?</h6>

						<p>Our warranty covers hardware failures and other innate defects that were not discovered by our technicians. The warranty does not cover defects caused by the misuse of the product. The term ‘misuse’ encompasses, but is not limited to: water damages, external damages caused by, e.g. dropping or crushing the product, and any other damages caused by the ‘abnormal’ use of the product. Software/programs are not covered by the warranty. If a customer opens the device against Apple’s instructions, the warranty will not cover any issues. If the customer send a device or accessory back for a warranty claim or replacement by post the customer has to bear the shipping costs of this. If a faulty product is returned to us for a warranty claim inspection and the issue is not covered by the warranty, the customer will be charged a service and administration fee of £50.</p>

						<h6>HOW DO YOU RETURN A DAMAGED PRODUCT COVERED BY OUR WARRANTY?</h6>

						<p>If you experience problems with a product purchased from us which is still covered by our warranty, you simply raise a warranty claim in your account with us describing the issue you are experiencing. You will then need to send the product in to our workshop for an inspection and repairs if need be. If our technicians are unable to repair the product within a period of two weeks we reserve the right to replace the product with an equivalent or superior product. The replacement product has to be approved by the customer before we replace it. If you have any questions in regards to our warranty policy, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

						<h6>EXTENDED WARRANTY</h6>

						<p>As mentioned above it’s possible to extend the warranty for a small fee. The warranty can be extended to cover as much as an additional 18 months. The extended warranty is an add-on which you can select when you order the product through our onlinestore. Please note that it is not possible to buy extended warranty after the purchase of the device has been made.</p>
